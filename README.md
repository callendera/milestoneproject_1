## Check out my website [here](https://milestoneproject-1-gatorwam19.c9users.io/index.html)

## Objective
My 1st Milestone Project is used to display my skills learned in the following sections: 
HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, and User Centric Frontend Developement.

## Project Description
My webpage is a band website for The Monkees (1960s Rockband). 
The main goal of the webpage is to attract fans and prospective fans. 
Within the site you will see audio and video sections, a photo gallery, 
a bio of the band and its' members, upcoming concerts/tours, contact info, social media links, 
and a way for the user to book the band for events. 
The site is functional on all screen sizes allowing for a vast variety of fan base to visit the page. 

## Tools/Technologies
Within my code I used HTML and CSS languages using Cloud9, along with FontAwesome icons, Google Fonts, JavaScript, and Bootstrap4.
This Milestone Project is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
