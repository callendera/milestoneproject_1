# My 1st Milestone Project

## Check out my website [here](https://milestoneproject-1-gatorwam19.c9users.io/index.html)

## Objective
My 1st Milestone Project is to used to display my skills learned in the following sections: 
HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, and User Centric Frontend Developement.

## Project Description and UX
My webpage is a band website for The Monkees (1960s Rockband). 
The main goal of the webpage is to attract fans and prospective fans, 
inviting them to check out audio and video on the site along while providing
them with the ability to book the band for private events and to come see The Monkees live on tour. 
Within the site you will see audio and video sections, a photo gallery, 
a bio of the band and its' members, upcoming concerts/tours, contact info, social media links, 
and a way for the user to book the band for events. 


The site is functional on all screen sizes allowing for a vast variety of fan base to visit the page.
My process for providing a user friendly website was based solely on making the website as simple as possible.
With The Monkees being a 1960s rock group and the growing popularity amoung young people with this style of music, 
a wide fan base needs to be focused on. The simplicity of the webpage allows for the older fans to be able to navigate smoothly, 
while the wide range of responsive design allows for the younger fan base to have easy access on any device. 

* As an old fan of The Monkees tv show and band, I want to listen to some audio and watch a video of the group, so I visit the site's Landing page
* I am a prospective fan of The Monkees, I want to see them live and check out their social media pages, so I visit the Concerts link on the Landing page and buy tickets then click on the Social Media links provided at the bottom of the page.
* I am currently a fan, I am planning an event and need entertainment, in the navigation bar and in the Concerts section I have the option to book the band.
